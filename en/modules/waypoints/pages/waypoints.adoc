= Waypoints

Waypoints are geo-referenced points that can be added to the chart. They perform a number of functions.

* Mark alter course points on a planned route
* Mark a significant location on the chart such as an anchorage or isolated danger
* Are used by a plugin to mark a location that is linked to information on the Internet
* Mark a man overboard position
